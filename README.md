# Files from CTFs in 2020
by qpwoeirut

Most of these directories are a complete mess of solutions, challenge files, and failed solutions.
The only ones that are organized and have writeups are:
* redpwnCTF
* Chujowy CTF
* UIUCTF

For organized directories, all challenges should be in their own folders.
If a challenge is not in `unsolved` or `solved_by_teammates` then it should have a writeup in the README.
Every organized directory will also have a README.
